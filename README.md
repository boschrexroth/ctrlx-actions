# Actions to build Apps for ctrlX

This repository contains GitHub Actions to build Apps for [ctrlX OS](https://apps.boschrexroth.com/microsites/ctrlx-automation/en/portfolio/ctrlx-os/) and [ctrlX CORE](https://apps.boschrexroth.com/microsites/ctrlx-automation/en/portfolio/ctrlx-core/) from [Bosch Rexroth](https://www.boschrexroth.com/).

You can use these actions in your repositories workflows to easily create an automated CI/CD pipeline. There are multiple actions that support you in different task (e.g. building, cross-compiling for ARM64, validation of json files, ...).

## Usage

The examples below show how to use the different actions in your GitHub Workflow. 

### Build Snap

#### Example - Build Snap

Build a snap for amd64 architecture (e.g. for ctrlX CORE X7 or ctrlX COREvirtual).

```yaml
name: build ctrlX Snap (amd64)

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - 
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - 
        name: Build the Snap
        id: build-snap
        uses: boschrexroth/ctrlx-actions/build-snap@v1
        with: 
            architecture: amd64 # required ('amd64' or 'arm64')
      - 
        name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: v0.0.1
          files: ${{steps.build-snap.outputs.path-snap}}
```

Build a snap for arm64 architecture (e.g. for ctrlX CORE X3).

```yaml
name: build ctrlX Snap (arm64)

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - 
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - 
        name: Build the Snap
        id: build-snap
        uses: boschrexroth/ctrlx-actions/build-snap@v1
        with: 
            architecture: arm64 # required ('amd64' or 'arm64')
      - 
        name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: v0.0.1
          files: ${{steps.build-snap.outputs.path-snap}}
```

#### Inputs - Build Snap

| Name           | Required   | Type    | Description                                                                    |
|----------------|------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `architecture` | `true`     | String  | Snap architecture ('amd64' or 'arm64')                                         |

#### Outputs - Build Snap

| Name           | Type    | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path-snap`    | String  | Absolute path to the snap                                                                   |

### Build App

Build an App for ctrlX. A `.app` file ("App") is a package archive which combines multiple snaps for different architectures (arm64, amd64). It may also contain additional files, like digital signatures. By packaging all in a single file, it enables a simple distribution of an App for ctrlX OS.

#### Example - Build App

```yaml
name: build ctrlX Snaps and package as App

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - 
        name: Build snap for amd64
        id: amd64-build
        uses: boschrexroth/ctrlx-actions/build-snap@v1
        with: 
            architecture: amd64
      - 
        name: Build snap for arm64
        id: arm64-build
        uses: boschrexroth/ctrlx-actions/build-snap@v1
        with: 
            architecture: arm64
      - 
        name: Package App for ctrlX OS
        uses: boschrexroth/ctrlx-actions/build-app@v1
        with: 
            path-amd64-snap: ${{steps.amd64-build.outputs.path-snap}}
            path-arm64-snap: ${{steps.arm64-build.outputs.path-snap}}
      - 
        name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: v0.0.1
          files: binaries.zip
```

#### Inputs - Build App

| Name              | Required   | Type    | Description                                                                     |
|-------------------|------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app-name`        | `false`    | String  | Name of the .app file (default: name of repository)                             |
| `path-amd64-snap` | `false`    | String  | Path to the amd64 snap file (default: '*amd64.snap')                            |
| `path-arm64-snap` | `false`    | String  | Path to the arm64 snap file (default: '*arm64.snap')                            |

### Validate JSON schema

Validate JSON for ctrlX specific schemas. `.json` files are used at multiple occasions when creating an App for ctrlX. Use this action to validate those json files against corresponding json-schema which are provided by Bosch Rexroth. See: https://github.com/boschrexroth/json-schema

#### Example - Validate JSON schema

```yaml
name: validate JSON schema

on: push

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - 
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - 
        name: Validate JSON
        uses: boschrexroth/ctrlx-actions/validate-json-schema@v1
        with:
          json-schema: test-schema.json # path to json schema
          json-file: test-schema.json   # path to json file
```

#### Inputs - Validate JSON schema

| Name           | Required   | Type    | Description                                                                    |
|----------------|------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `json-schema`  | `false`    | String  | Path to json schema (default: `package-manifest.v1.1.schema.json`)             |
| `json-file`    | `true`     | String  | Path to json file                                                              |
| `ajv-options`  | `false`    | String  | ajv options to parse (default: `--spec=draft2020 --strict=false --all-errors`) |
